# Large File Download Pipeline

A modular serverless pipeline for generating and delivering large files.
Originally built for AWS Lambda, it demonstrates how to:
- Query data from a database
- Write large files (CSV, ZIP, etc.)
- Store files in a bucket
- Notify users when the file is ready
- Handle Lambda timeout safely
- Clean up resources
