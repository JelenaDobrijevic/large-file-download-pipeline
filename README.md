A modular **serverless-style pipeline** for generating and delivering large files.  
Originally inspired by AWS Lambda patterns.

## âœ¨ Features

- Query data from a (mock) database
- Generate large files (CSV, ZIP, etc.)
- Store files locally (mock bucket)
- Notify users when the file is ready
- Handle timeout & graceful cleanup
- Automated linting, testing and dependency updates

## ðŸ§© Architecture

Each process is independent and communicates via a shared `Context`:

1. Logger â†’ 2. Config â†’ 3. Database â†’ 4. File â†’ 5. Notification â†’ 6. Clean
